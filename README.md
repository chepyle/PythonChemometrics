# Interferogram Analysis
This is supporting information for the AIChE presentation [Opportunities in Spectroscopic Analysis: Chemometrics++](https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2015/webprogram/Paper430942.html)

It aims to process a series of raw interferograms into a predictive chemometric model using a variety of approaches available in Python.  Requires latest (as of Nov 2015) versions of the libraries used in the notebook file, especially ipython, pandas and matplotlib.
